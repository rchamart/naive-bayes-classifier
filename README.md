# naive-bayes-classifier
a simple naive bayes classifier, that originated as an assignment in cs373 

This was an intro to python, dataset processing, numpy and pandas, thus the messy and inefficient code. My other classifiers are faster and cleaner than this, however, hopefully it can provide some insight to students struggling with the concepts.
